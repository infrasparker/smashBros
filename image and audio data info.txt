Images are sorted into groups of pictures representing move states. Each consecutive image must be named a numerical value higher than the that of the previous state.

Image Data is organized as follows:

width: <in game width as number>
SCDs: {{<leftx>, <lefty>}{<rightx>, <righty>}{<topx>,<topy>}{<botx>,<boty>}}
frames: (<first frame>,<last frame>)
**hitbubbles: {{<centerx>,<centery>,<radius>}(<damage>,<baseKB>,<KBScaling>,<angle>,<priority>,<SFX group)}
**new:

**indicates an optional field for states with hitbubbles - exempt if not available
